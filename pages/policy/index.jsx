In this case, we require you to disclose your name, email address, phone number, position, level and your CV or message as well as job application details. You are also free to share with us your website, blog, portfolio, LinkedIn profile, and/or College/University, which we may use during selection of applicants.

We may use them in order to better evaluate your request and prepare an appropriate response. We kindly ask you not to provide us with any excessive personal data, including sensitive data.

We process the data you provided us through the “Contact us” form to provide the Services you requested, including to provide customer care and support, detect, prevent and address technical issues, or simply to answer to your requests. We also process the data you provided us via the “Career” form to provide you with all needed information, as well as to be aware of our potential employee, and to contact you.

We could also use some personal data in view of our legitimate interests. Legitimate interests are a possibility to lawfully use your personal data without your explicit consent. This is possible insofar such interests are not outweighed by your interests. In our case, we have legitimate interests, for instance, in the effective delivery of the Services or in building the relationship with potential employees and contractors/subcontractors and communicating with them regarding possible cooperation with us. We believe that our legitimate interests correspond to your interest in obtaining the Services and enter into possible cooperation.
